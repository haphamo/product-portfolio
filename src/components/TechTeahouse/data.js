		'I recently started a coding bootcamp to switch careers into tech but knew no one in the industry. I found it difficult finding quality tech events where I can learn something new and am given the chance to practice my learning. If I did attend an event, I found that lining up to speak to a panelist takes way too long and the interaction is cut short like a doctor’s appointment. Furthermore, it was hard finding someone to come to an event with me and I was initially very intimidated attending tech events alone.',

		'I wanted to be a part of a inclusive tech community where I could meet other like-mind people and build new friendships. A community where I can meet people in the industry, that can give insight, advice or just have great conversation with. Additionally, I wanted to find out about the latest tech events and be able to invite others to events I am attending. I’ve met two great co-founders with the same vision and the projects below outline my journey to grow our communi-tea.'
