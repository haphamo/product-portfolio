 Jen's Personal Website

Tech Teahouse is a fully volunteer-run grassroots community organization. We are 100% funded by the generosity of corporate & community partners. Tech Teahouse delivers free educational workshops to underrepresented groups, and powers programs that directly support greater diversity and collaboration within Torontoâ€™s thriving tech sector.

This is a simple front-end website to showcase my Product Management Skills and my journey as I build and grow this community.
